# SnelTrein - the fastest way to find your train connections in The Netherlands


About
-------
This app for Android allows you to plan your train journey with as few clicks as possible.

The "itch" that sparked this project was that I had to go through about 6 screens with buttons to find a journey on existing apps. I thought I could do better.

SnelTrein uses gps to detect where you are and display near stations as the first options.

When you select station A as departure, and you often travel to B, D and E from A, it will put B, D and E on top of the list in the destination selector.

Sounds vague, but use it. It is awesome.


You need to
-------
Enter your own api key in the source.

Install Eclipse with an Android plugin and the ADB to start developing.

Let me know when you edit something. I'd like that :)

Design is not one of my strengths. If you're a good designer and would like to improve the UI: let me know.
